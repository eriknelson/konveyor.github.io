# What is Konveyor?

Konveyor is **a community of people** passionate about helping others **modernize and migrate their applications** to the hybrid cloud by **building tools, identifying patterns,** and providing advice on how to break down monoliths, adopt containers, and embrace Kubernetes.

{% include youtube_embed.html id="T-LN2CE9MPU" %}  

The community hosts regular [Meetups](meetups.md) where community members talk and demonstrate things they've learned. If you'd like to receive invitations to the meetups or propose a talk you can [join the google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/konveyorio).
